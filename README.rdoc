== Postit

1. Postit-template is an app developed as part of the second Ruby on Rails course i took with Tealeaf Academy, a 4-month online Rails development course.

2. This app is a clone of Reddit.com where users can create, view and edit their posts. Other users can then upvote or downvote the post. There is a full feature authentication system coded up from scratch (without any reliance on the Devise gem). Additionally, the voting function in this app has been ajaxified, admin-only features are available and searching by slugs is enabled.
